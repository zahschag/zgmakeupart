	<article>Hi! My name is Zahscha, I’m a Make up artist. Since 2008 I’m a self-thought, from the youtube guru’s from around the girl. I’m professional and very energetic. I've been a makeup artist for about 3 years. My goal and vision is to embrace the feminity without compromising the beautiful features of the face. I love making key features of the face stand out, giving a polish sophisticated touch to a person's makeup.<article>
